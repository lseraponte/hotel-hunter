Disgusting.  \r\n\r\nBedroom carpet was manky.  Paint chipped and peeling throughout.  \r\n\r\ncoffee machine but no milk provided, i would have preferred milk to the packets of love hearts. \r\n\r\nwas hastily shown to my room when I arrived but no guidance given on keys/front doors keys etc.  staff were simply too buys downstairs in the pub to offer a proper welcome.  very poor."
